# A note on the reading logic; the approach implemented here does the following:
# 1. Upon initialization, it waits for `timeout` seconds for any payloads to come in
#    on subscribed topics. I.e. it collects data.
# 2. Upon carrying out a read(), it subscribes to the topic for that read, checks whether
#    data for a desired topic is available, and if so it returns it
#
# This means that during the very first reading cycle, no data is likely to be returned. But
# since the broker should remember this client ID and its subscriptions, any QoS 1 and QoS 2
# messages that are received in-between reading cycles should subsequently be buffered,
# and delivered upon the following reading cycle.
